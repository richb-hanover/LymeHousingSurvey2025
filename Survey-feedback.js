The same people who balk at fully funding the school will balk at necessary increases in the cost of maintaining roads and/or improving roads ahead of increased traffic. A large percentage of households may not have kids in the school right now, but the almost all had kids at one point. If you increase housing stock I am certain you will attract more people who want their kids in the school. Which I am all for. But you will need to be ready to deal with that costing more money, too.

If Lyme becomes more densely populated then there will be less incentive to live here over neighboring towns. In fact, other towns will become more appealing and Lyme property value will fall. ",

      "I think Lyme is a special place.  It has great outdoors spaces, rural character, beautiful in-town area by the green.  Lyme is not Grafton county and Lyme is not Sunapee.  It is different and special.  I think we should generally leave it how it is and not mess with it.  If we build a bunch of affordable housing, that will change the character of the town and impact the school, housing prices, everything.  I know that people need an affordable place to live.  But every town doesn't have to be exactly the same.  Our taxes are high because we have limited development and lots of undeveloped land in current use.  I accept that as a trade for living in this beautiful rural town.  People from other communities can come here and use those lands and outdoor spaces.  If we are going to build a bunch of affordable housing and \"normalize Lyme\" we might as well take all that land out of current use and start raising tax revenue on it.  I don't want ot do this, but that seems like the road we would be going down if we want to make Lyme like any other NH town.   ",

Besides that, look at old maps of Lyme and allow new houses wheee there are cellar holes or evidence of old houses. Selectively open class six roads like East Street and Shoestrap all the way down to river road for careful, limited development. Have we even regained the level of our peak population in the early 1800s? At least we could match and slightly exceed that!",

      "I think Lyme’s minimum lot size requirements are too large, especially outside the village centers. They make it difficult to create smaller, more attainable homes for local families, teachers, and older residents who want to stay in town. Reducing lot sizes in areas like East Lyme, Holts Ledge, and parts of the Rural District — while keeping appropriate protections for the Mountain & Forest areas — would allow for modest growth that still fits Lyme’s character.  Smaller lot options, accessory dwelling units, and clustered developments could help Lyme offer “a variety of housing types” as described in the Master Plan, without changing what makes our town special. This would strengthen the community and make it possible for more people to live here long-term.",

    "11. Lyme School Explanation":
      "The school’s capacity should be considered, but it should not serve as a limiting factor for housing development. Lyme’s enrollment has remained steady for decades, and adding up to 30 new students over 15 years represents very gradual growth, less than two students per year. That is well within the school’s ability to manage through natural fluctuations, staffing adjustments, or modest operational changes.  More importantly, Lyme needs a balance of housing types to sustain a healthy, multigenerational community. If new housing is restricted based on potential school growth, it risks excluding younger families entirely, which could lead to a long-term decline in school enrollment and community vibrancy.  Instead of treating school capacity as a constraint, Lyme can plan for moderate, well-placed housing growth that keeps enrollment stable, supports local teachers and staff, and helps maintain the town’s social and economic vitality.",

Thoughtful, well-planned change can help Lyme remain vibrant while preserving what makes it special. Look at Fairlee, VT — they’ve managed to reinvest in their community and bring new life to the town without losing its character. Lyme can do the same by encouraging small-scale, intentional growth that supports local businesses, offers a range of housing options, and keeps the town’s unique sense of place alive for future generations.",

Creating more attainable housing options—especially near the village center—will allow long-time residents, young families, and older adults to stay and contribute to the life of the town. Careful, small-scale development that fits Lyme’s character can strengthen our schools, local businesses, and civic life. Change is inevitable, but if we guide it with intention, we can ensure Lyme remains welcoming, vibrant, and true to its roots.",

      "Fairlee, VT seems to have identified a reasonable solution. I imagine that it would involve building or renovating something such that numerous small units could be contained in one structure. I do not believe that Lyme could possibly build affordable or so-called attainable single family homes. Hanover and Lebanon seem to have reasonable options, albeit not many. What about a model like Gile Hill? Perhaps not suitable for Lyme in scope/size but conceptually, units that are price controlled at point of purchase and again at sale. ",

      "If the taxes continue to increase at the current rate, I won't likely stay here. This feels unfortunate as I have always appreciated Lyme and the community and have done quite a bit to work in Lyme as a volunteer with various organizations and I've gone to lengths to meet people and help build community. I would love to believe that I would be able to stay here after I retire which will happen in 5-10 years. It is indeed disappointing and somewhat disenfranchising as I've heard and participated in many conversations about taxes and services in Lyme, yet all seem to fall on deaf ears in the end. ",

    "18. Smaller house explanation":
      "Once my kids are gone, I don't see a point to continuing to live in and maintain a 4 bedroom 3000 sq ft house. In most other American communities, people can downsize as they age without moving away from the community that they lived in and loved for decades. It would be nice if Lyme could figure that out, particularly considering the wealth of models out there to look at. The Planning Board, Zoning Board, Select Board seem quite focused on not building or on disallowing building out of fear that people with students might move to town. Funny thing is, I see that happening often, particularly people with multiple kids building large single family homes. If we build smaller units, people would possibly have something to downsize to and from my perspective, small units would not be desirable for families with kids anyway. ",

    "20. Other thoughts":
      "I hesitated to complete this survey as I have lived here for almost 20 years and have heard this conversation about housing for most of those 20 years. Ad nauseum. Nothing happens. There seems to be no personal at the proverbial \"wheel\". I'm not a huge fan of NH state government but feel buoyed by the possibility that change will eventually happen due to their impatience with towns like Lyme that just refuse to build anything. I am a person who would like to stay in Lyme, work here in the community and with people in the community. It is disheartening to today believe that this may not be possible. Keep in mind that many people, if/when they believe they either cannot afford to stay here, maintain a large home, or become frustrated by the high tax rate that is not accompanied by needed service(s), will sell. And, who will buy the 4br single family homes? People with kids. So, the problem that you are focused on keeping from happening looms even if you don't build. Another issue I'd point to - assessed value of homes. Many homes seem to be a bit off in terms of assessed/market value. Improving the assessments so that they better reflect/match market value could help quite a few people (1) control budgets (2) impart fairness to the tax code. Building? Try for  small units. 1 br. 2 br. Small but functional kitchens. A tv room and a bath. Keep it simple. But, worth pointing out that building is not the only means of solving/making taxes more reasonable for many people. ",

We are a town with open spaces. That is what draws people. We do not need to become a small town with the look of houses and tall buildings lining our main streets and roads. If you are going to encourage ADU's and cluster housing, please consider what your home would be like if that were happening on a piece of land abutting your property. 35' away from your line isn't far.

The populations are older and need to be supported while also bringing in / developing fresh new ideas and community leaders.  I believe we can both take care of those who are burdened by high property taxes and cost of living, while also encouraging younger people to live here.",

In fact, families that have lived in Lyme for generations are being left not being able to live in Lyme because of the steep prices. We need fewer exclusive properties and more moderate income properties.

      "We should absolutely promote slow, responsible growth.  We should be careful not to promote an abundance or rental units that do not carry the tax burden that they potentially create.  For example, a rental unit that has pays property taxes annually in the $5K range and has 1 to 2 children in the school system, is going to be a continuous negative contributor to our overall bottom line.  A new house that is paying $50K and with a family that has students, will more likely have members that may want to age in place or at least remain in Lyme beyond when the children age out of the school system.  A few additional larger contributing houses are better for our long term heath than a bunch of small dwelling units.  \n\nThis would mean we would have to potentially relax our zoning a bit to allow 2-4 new houses a year.",

      "If we don't let people build housing (of all types!) then Lyme will look increasingly like a retirement community. I think Lyme can be for retirees AND young families AND grad students AND farm workers AND many other types of residents if we make it an attractive place to build new housing. We don't even need to cut down forests to do it - although I don't necessarily have a problem with that.\n\nWe need to get out of our own way and let people develop their land so the next Stellas or Lyme Inn or neighbor can open up shop. Building housing will benefit everyone. Lyme isn't going to turn into Boston or NYC just because we relax our zoning. It's not even going to look like Leb or Burlington. It will just become even more attractive because we'll have more of what everyone needs - a place to live!",

      'A significant percentage of the "white space" in the map are owned by a relatively few land owners.  Compounding this reality is the zoning laws that require a minimum acreage to build new homes and/or restrictions around multi-unit dwelllings.  This is ultimately an anti-growth approach, and will prevent Lyme from building meaningful amount of affordable housing/multi-unit housing unless changed.  We are capping our revenue potential and it\'s clear that our tax bills are reflecting that basic economic reality.',

      "I’d like to ask the members of the committee to review some numbers that some may find familiar, and while doing so, temporarily ignore the non-financial values of conservation easements and current use.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nRich Menge, Chair  - 179.5 acres of land in Lyme.        \nAssessed (taxable) Value\t$202,200 ($1,126/acre)\nAppraised Value\t$1,118,400 ($6,230/acre)\n82% tax reduction vs. appraised for the Chair of this committee.\n—> $28.19/$1000 x ($6230/acre-$1126/acre)(179.5 acres)= $25,826 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Chairman Menge.   ($5700 actual tax on land)\n    \n\nTim Cook, Vice Chair  - 24 acres of land in Lyme.\nAssessed (taxable) Value\t$216,300 ($9,012/acre)\nAppraised Value\t$485,200 ($20,216/acre)\n55% tax reduction vs. appraised for the Vice Chair of this committee.\n—> $28.19/$1000 x ($20216/acre-$9012/acre)(36.97 acres)= $7,580 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Mr. Cook.   ($6097 actual tax on land)\n\n\nNat Niles - 36.97 acres of land in Lyme.\nAssessed (taxable) Value\t$477,100 ($11,775/acre)\nAppraised Value\t$588,700 ($15,504/acre)\n24% tax reduction vs. appraised\n—> $28.19/$1000 x ($15504/acre-$11775/acre)(36.97 acres)= $3,886 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Mr. Niles  ($13449 actual tax on land)\n\n\nDavid Kahn - 134.1 acres of land in Lyme.\nAssessed (taxable) Value\t$463,300 ($3,454/acre)\nAppraised Value\t$1,143,000 ($8,523/acre)\n59% tax reduction vs. appraised\n—> $28.19/$1000 x ($8523/acre-$3454/acre)(134.1 acres)= $19,162 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Mr. Kahn  ($13,060 actual  tax on land)\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nWith that read, \n\nA) In aggregate, these four committee members alone own 1% of the town’s land and decreased their annual property taxes by $56,545.  \n\nB) The Lyme budget increased $155,969 between 2024 (actual) and 2025 (proposed).  \n\nC) 36% of the 2024 to 2025 budget increase was contained in the tax strategies of just four of these Committee members.  \n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nNext part.  Let’s compare those to the property of another committee member.\n\nVicki Smith, 1.1 acres, on Market Street.\nAssessed (taxable) Value\t$205,300 ($186,636/acre)\nAppraised Value\t$205,300 ($186,636/acre)\n0% tax reduction vs. appraised\n—> $28.19/$1000 x ($0)(1.1 acres)= $0 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Ms. Smith ($5787 actual tax on land.)  \n\nWith that read, \n\nA) Small parcel of in the Lyme Common district have no opportunity for conservation easement and current use tax reduction schemes that owners of larger parcels of land in town make use of.  \n\nB) As we see with Ms. Smith’s property, small parcels of land in parts of Lyme can much higher the assessed land tax rate than larger lots.  Specifically here, Ms. Smith pays 50x the assessed rate per acre than the average assessed rate of the four committee members above.\n\nC) Chairman Menge pays less in tax on his 180 acres than Ms. Smith paid on her 1 acre.  \n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThis. is. bonkers.  \n\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n\nSo I’m very aware of how the Republican-led NH legislature is downshifting costs to property taxes in towns and cities, and how this is ballooning costs.\n\nRegardless of that issue, what we are dealing with above is local tax gamesmanship of conservation easement and current use policies by the few to the determent of the many.  And some of those making use of this are reading this right now.\n\nSo when the community is asked to figure out how to afford to live in this town, we’re going to have to deal with how a small number of residents (including members of this committee) are people figured out to drastically reduce their tax liability using conservation easement and current use.    And you’ve asked the rest who can’t exploit that legal loophole to come up with answers.  We’re pointing at your loopholes.   \n\nWhat I request is this:\n\nGive us the total dollar amount in assessed vs. appraised LAND value in Lyme.  What’s the difference between those two numbers?  And what would be the tax on that difference? \nFrom there, let’s imagine a path where that assessed value went up 10% closer to the appraised value… or 25%… or 50%.  What would happen to our OVERALL town and school budget?  Give us the numbers -  We’re all smart people here - most of us have advanced degrees.  That way we get an idea of how much more the smaller parcels in town are paying in taxes to subsidize the tax schemes of the larger landholders.  \n\nI think that’s important to know, as because as Mr. Kahn said recently,  “I don’t know if it’s fair to ask the citizens of the town of Lyme to use their taxes to subsidize an individual family like that.”  ",

So great job, Zoning Board!  You did your job, got your housing value appreciation, and screwed over the next generation of new Lymies.  Enjoy your retirement, but don’t complain you can’t afford to live here.\n\nSide note - to the best of my knowledge, this policy was never explicitly stated to the town.  ",

Do you think they don't notice Lyme locking up 92% of the land and doing nothing?  It's shameful.  Leb doesn't have this cultural imperative to  interested to put up more and more apartments on Mt. Support Road, but they know they have to do SOMETHING.  Lyme is pricing out even doctors with this flaccid, hand-on-the-chin response.  Do something.  It may not be perfect.  But that's okay.  Perfect is the enemy of good.  Act.  Build.  Step up.  ",

That said, if we continually increase supply of housing at the rates indicated by the folks at the UVLSRPC we will have a surplus of housing  starting in 15 years. This type of growth will change the landscape of our town. I would urge the Lyme planning board to focus on what our grandkids will see?  Will Lyme look like many towns in Massachusetts? Or can we preserve the open spaces and clean air? Or will we litter  our landscape with abandoned houses because we have too many? 2 new structures in town per year is a lot... maybe already too many. \n\nThank you for your efforts and for seeking public input! \n\n ",

      'Overall, it would be nice to keep Lyme the same. However, I think that some of the current zoning restrictions could be loosened easily to allow for a sub division of property. Such as the driveway length restriction, road frontage restriction, and acreage restriction. We pay a lot in taxes for land that can only be looked at. It would be nice to have the value reflect that of a potential sub division such as say 1 house on a 5 acre lot and not 10 acres. There are also too many loopholes for the zoning to pull into each scenario such as "agricultural soils" and other things of that nature which reduces the overall lot from a potential sub division. I do not think we need to blow Lyme up and allow for it to turn into Hanover, but, we certainly could use a little more options for residents in my opinion',

There are a lot of large parcels (we have one that is nearly 40 acres) yet we cannot develop a second residence that could be used as a rental property and serve as both attainable and/or affordable housing. The town should consider easing these requirement to allow taxpayers to build a second residence and/or accessory dwelling unit.",

      "This is so focused on housing which is important, but a huge part of this puzzle is how Lyme is using the current use program. Because of large parcels owned mostly by two Lyme residents that are immediately put in conservation/current use and not taxed, ~93% of the land in town isn't taxed. There is consensus in the 35-50 year old generation in town that current tax levels are unsustainable and this is a direct result of the current use program. It should be reconsidered as it has a larger impact on taxes that having additional housing to shoulder the burden, does.  ",
